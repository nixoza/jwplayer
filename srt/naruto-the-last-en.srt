00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:24,048
THE LAST: NARUTO THE MOVIE

2
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:32,046
A long time ago, in an era where 
there was no concept of 'shinobi',

3
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:35,046
in an attempt to end an era of violence,

4
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:37,046
a certain someone bit a forbidden fruit

5
00:00:37,046 --> 00:00:40,046
and gained the power of chakra.

6
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:45,046
However, as time passed, they
became obsessed with that power.

7
00:00:45,096 --> 00:00:49,090
To bring justice to the world,
what is it that we need?

8
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,046
Power or love?

9
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:56,096
This question would
start an arduous war...

10
00:00:57,046 --> 00:01:01,046
which has continued
throughout the generations.

11
00:02:09,057 --> 00:02:13,046
Hey, if you're a Hyuga 
show us your Byakugan!

12
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:16,030
If you can't 
don't show your face around here!

13
00:02:16,033 --> 00:02:18,056
Your eyes are really creepy.

14
00:02:18,062 --> 00:02:20,026
I bet you're
actually a monster, right?

15
00:02:20,026 --> 00:02:23,010
You Byakugan monster!

16
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:30,096
Hey, stop it!

17
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:33,097
What's your problem?

18
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:35,096
I'm Uzumaki Naruto!

19
00:02:36,017 --> 00:02:38,026
I'm the future hokage!

20
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:40,022
The 'future hokage'?

21
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:41,084
Are you some kind of moron?

22
00:02:41,086 --> 00:02:44,096
Prepare yourself!
Kagebunshin no jutsu!

23
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:51,046
I'm going to beat you!

24
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:52,046
Me too!

25
00:02:58,056 --> 00:03:00,046
Take that!

26
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:09,046
We really taught this guy a lesson!

27
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:11,031
What's up with this "future hokage"?

28
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:16,046
For being so cocky,
 let's take care of his red scarf!

29
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:24,046
It's not over yet!
 This time I will bet on an awesome jutsu!

30
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:30,046
Are you okay?

31
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:32,046
It's nothing.

32
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,084
Your scarf.  Those boys they--

33
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:39,046
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:41,031
Don't worry about it.

35
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,019
Wait...

36
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:50,046
Thank you so much.

37
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:53,046
See you!

38
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:12,022
If the world were to end tomorrow,

39
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:14,046
who would you like to spend your
last day with?

40
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:17,062
Like that would ever happen.

41
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:19,046
Just suppose...

42
00:04:19,046 --> 00:04:21,052
The moon began to fall.

43
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:23,064
If it's the end of the world,

44
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:26,046
I wish meat would fall instead of the moon!

45
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:32,022
If the moon started falling, 
I would protect you.

46
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:35,060
Like I would ever want you 
to protect me.

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,070
Write down who you'd want to spend
your last day on Earth with.

48
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,053
That's impossible...

49
00:04:45,096 --> 00:04:50,009
I don't have a Dad or a Mom

50
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:52,027
or any friends.

51
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:01,068
Hey, Naruto!

52
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:03,046
Don't throw away your paper!

53
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:07,029
But there's no way
the world is gonna end!

54
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:10,065
I'm not saying it will, I'm just saying if it does!

55
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:13,022
Well, it ain't gonna happen.

56
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:54,053
THE LAST: NARUTO THE MOVIE

57
00:05:58,053 --> 00:06:00,051
This is a celestial decree

58
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:04,008
upon the Hyuga clan.

59
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,027
I will ask you one last time.

60
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:10,070
Let me hear your answer, 
Hiashi Hyuga.

61
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,030
The answer, which will
decide the future of your clan.

62
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,051
This is the Hyuga's...

63
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:19,055
...reply!

64
00:06:19,057 --> 00:06:20,040
How foolish.

65
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,068
Today I'm your special coach,
 so pay attention!

66
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:25,005
- Naruto-senpai!
- Naruto-senpai!

67
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:32,077
I never expected him to become such
high stakes material.

68
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,064
You say 'steak'?

69
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,064
-'High stakes' as in popular with girls.

70
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:39,049
His efforts in the war two years ago

71
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:41,066
turned him into the village 
hero after all.

72
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:42,074
Yeah.

73
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,061
Thank you very much.

74
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,004
All right, eat your fill.

75
00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:56,022
- Thanks for the food!
- Thanks for the food!

76
00:07:56,046 --> 00:07:57,064
Naruto-niichan!

77
00:07:57,064 --> 00:07:59,067
Oh, Konohamaru?

78
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,085
I have something to show you.

79
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,065
What is it?

80
00:08:02,059 --> 00:08:04,085
- It's grandfather Hiruzen's stuff.

81
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:07,087
I found it all during spring cleaning.

82
00:08:07,094 --> 00:08:09,054
Hey, is this...?

83
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:11,055
Don't you dare call it junk.

84
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,064
They're very precious.

85
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,050
These are...?

86
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,010
- They're not junk okay?!

87
00:08:36,077 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm Uzumaki Naruto!

88
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:46,056
Time sure flies...

89
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:49,067
RINNE FESTIVAL

90
00:08:46,056 --> 00:08:49,067
Sales for the Festival Rinne have already started.

91
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:52,008
Naruto-senpai!

92
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:56,008
Please accept my
Rinne Festival present.

93
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:57,061
For me?

94
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,035
I'm always cheering for you!

95
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:00,088
I made it myself!

96
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:03,006
- Please accept it!
- Please accept it!

97
00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:05,028
T-thank you.

98
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:07,081
Thank you very much.

99
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:10,020
Hinata!

100
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:12,063
Oh, Sakura.

101
00:09:12,088 --> 00:09:14,031
Knitting something?

102
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:16,038
That's a surprise.

103
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:18,065
I'm making a scarf.

104
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:22,035
W-what is it?

105
00:09:22,038 --> 00:09:24,006
Give it your all, okay?

106
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:28,041
It's a present for him, right?

107
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:39,085
He's become really popular lately.

108
00:09:40,003 --> 00:09:41,057
Oh, really?

109
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:46,000
People even come
all the way from other villages

110
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:47,098
just to take pictures of him.

111
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,024
Oh...

112
00:09:49,094 --> 00:09:51,086
Don't just say 'Oh'.

113
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:54,017
Hurry up and finish that scarf.

114
00:09:54,044 --> 00:09:56,037
O-okay.

115
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:58,015
Come on,

116
00:09:58,022 --> 00:10:00,033
you should have more confidence.

117
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,052
Be bold!

118
00:10:02,022 --> 00:10:03,062
O-okay.

119
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,076
It looks quite big, doesn't it?

120
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:34,064
All done!

121
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,085
I put my heart and soul into it.

122
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:41,015
I'm sure my feelings
will reach Naruto.

123
00:10:45,068 --> 00:10:47,047
But will they?

124
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,069
It's already late.

125
00:10:49,075 --> 00:10:51,057
Maybe tomorrow would be better?

126
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:55,077
No! I'll give it to him tonight.

127
00:10:56,004 --> 00:10:57,073
Or maybe tomorrow...

128
00:10:58,053 --> 00:10:59,087
No, tonight.

129
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,052
Or maybe tomorrow...

130
00:11:06,046 --> 00:11:09,037
Why don't you just hurry up
 and tell him how you feel already?

131
00:11:10,066 --> 00:11:11,068
Hanabi!

132
00:11:11,068 --> 00:11:14,010
If you were there all along why didn't you say so?!

133
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,012
Watching a girl agonize over love
is more fun.

134
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,078
That's no way for a child to talk.

135
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,050
I'm not a child,

136
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:25,057
my Byakugan's perception is as
good as any grown up!

137
00:11:25,062 --> 00:11:27,028
Anyway, look!

138
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:29,004
Isn't it cute?

139
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:31,012
Treating your kunai like a toy again.

140
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:37,085
He'll burst out laughing if your
tummy growls while you're confessing your love.

141
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:40,080
Who said I was going to confess anything?!

142
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:43,030
Rather than giving him a scarf,

143
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,000
maybe you should
try dressing a bit more fashionably?

144
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,023
Are you saying that the 
moon is falling?

145
00:11:49,044 --> 00:11:52,026
The moon is clearly getting closer to Earth.

146
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:54,091
Is that why there have been more meteorites lately?

147
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:56,000
I'll explain...

148
00:11:56,046 --> 00:11:59,050
As the two celestial bodies
get closer to each other,

149
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,079
their gravitational pull on each other increases.

150
00:12:02,046 --> 00:12:04,089
Once they come within a certain distance,

151
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:07,020
The moon's surface will begin to break apart.

152
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,054
I believe a part of the moon's
surface has begun to fall to Earth.

153
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:11,085
And what will happen?

154
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,004
The moon will completely disintegrate,

155
00:12:14,004 --> 00:12:16,088
and its fragments will rain over the Earth's surface.

156
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:20,028
If nothing is done, mankind will surely...

157
00:12:20,054 --> 00:12:22,001
Be wiped out, right?

158
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:24,028
Is this a natural phenomenon?

159
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:26,088
Or is this a man-made assault?

160
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:29,056
That is a good question.

161
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:39,009
It's getting to to that time of year when
ramen really hits the spot.

162
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:42,036
You only ever eat ramen all year long.

163
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,035
You really like ramen, don't you?

164
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:46,033
Yup, I love it.

165
00:12:46,094 --> 00:12:48,093
Five more orders of gyoza.

166
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,046
I can't eat five more orders.

167
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:54,017
Then don't have any.

168
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,084
Time to eat.

169
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:58,022
Oh...
Can't get this dirty.

170
00:12:58,097 --> 00:13:00,062
Hey, that scarf--

171
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:01,044
Oh, Hinata.

172
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:03,070
Join us if you haven't eaten.

173
00:13:04,003 --> 00:13:05,066
It's on me tonight!

174
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:09,090
He said something made him happy
and he wants to celebrate.

175
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:12,046
B-but...

176
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:16,096
Don't be shy, come and sit here.

177
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:18,033
Join us, Hinata.

178
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:20,082
O-okay.

179
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,041
Naruto-senpai!

180
00:13:24,075 --> 00:13:26,048
Hey, it's you guys.

181
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,064
Thanks for the presents
the other day.

182
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:33,054
Order whatever you want,

183
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:35,062
it's my treat 
as thanks for the presents.

184
00:13:35,062 --> 00:13:37,013
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you so much!

185
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:38,082
Hinata, you can order whatever you want too.

186
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,073
Over here, Senpai!

187
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,055
Let's eat together!

188
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:44,033
Hinata...?

189
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:45,079
What's wrong?

190
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:49,071
I'm sorry.
Actually, I'm quite full.

191
00:13:49,072 --> 00:13:51,032
Hinata!

192
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,042
Walk her home.

193
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:56,086
Walk Hinata home?

194
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:58,044
Why?

195
00:13:59,013 --> 00:14:00,026
Well...

196
00:14:00,026 --> 00:14:03,033
You can't let a young girl walk home alone at night.

197
00:14:01,026 --> 00:14:04,033
- Order ready!

198
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,033
- Coming!

199
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:05,081
Hinata's really strong,

200
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:08,024
no one in the village would dare mess with her.

201
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:10,047
Hinata!

202
00:14:10,054 --> 00:14:12,023
Oh, you're such an idiot!

203
00:14:12,088 --> 00:14:14,067
Why are you calling me an idiot?

204
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:17,002
Senpai, the gyoza are ready.

205
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:18,016
Let's eat!

206
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,054
He can be so dense.

207
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:25,069
You were going to give him the scarf weren't you?

208
00:14:26,006 --> 00:14:27,024
Yeah.

209
00:14:27,086 --> 00:14:30,089
You can do it, Hinata.
Be confident!

210
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:33,014
Thanks.

211
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:36,024
But how come you're encouraging
me so much?

212
00:14:36,027 --> 00:14:38,028
Well...

213
00:14:45,055 --> 00:14:47,085
Let's both do our best!

214
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,050
Both of us?

215
00:15:33,004 --> 00:15:34,041
Who's there?

216
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:42,010
Hanabi?

217
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:44,021
Super Beast Scroll!

218
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:04,081
Naruto...

219
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:10,075
I've always gazed at you from afar.

220
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:15,020
But from now on,
I want to always,

221
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,084
always stand by your side.

222
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:22,099
So I knitted
this with all my heart...

223
00:16:24,075 --> 00:16:28,046
Please, accept my feelings.

224
00:16:32,003 --> 00:16:34,014
All right, one more time.

225
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:36,068
Naruto...

226
00:16:37,087 --> 00:16:38,087
Hinata!

227
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,086
Good evening.

228
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:48,028
We saw each other earlier at Ichiraku.

229
00:16:47,075 --> 00:16:48,028
- Oh, that's right!

230
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:52,005
What's the matter?

231
00:16:53,068 --> 00:16:55,044
Th-that's a nice scarf.

232
00:16:57,013 --> 00:16:58,083
Oh, yeah.

233
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,028
Hey, it sounds like you're hungry.

234
00:17:04,028 --> 00:17:06,099
If you don't mind instant ramen, I have some in my room.

235
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:11,052
Didn't you want to talk to me?

236
00:17:11,075 --> 00:17:13,036
Hey, Hinata!

237
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,089
I wonder who gave it to him?

238
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:28,099
I'm happy for you, Naruto.

239
00:17:36,002 --> 00:17:37,038
Why are you crying?

240
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,025
You're getting the scarf wet.

241
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:44,051
I don't need it anymore.

242
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:47,018
Then, I'll take it.

243
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:50,011
Who are you?

244
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:55,022
I'm Toneri. I've come to retrieve you.

245
00:17:55,094 --> 00:17:56,096
'Retrieve' me?

246
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,074
What are you...? Let me go!

247
00:18:06,098 --> 00:18:09,077
Hey, you,
what are you doing to Hinata?

248
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:26,035
Tajuu Kagebunshin no jutsu!

249
00:18:37,064 --> 00:18:38,064
Hinata!

250
00:19:11,078 --> 00:19:13,006
Rasen Shuriken!

251
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:23,000
Hey you... Give Hinata back!

252
00:19:24,044 --> 00:19:25,044
Hold it!

253
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:41,099
Hinata, are you okay?

254
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:43,049
Yeah!

255
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:55,075
Rasengan!

256
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:07,004
My body is going numb.

257
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:08,046
My strength...

258
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,088
Hinata!

259
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:31,028
Your scarf is ruined.

260
00:20:32,016 --> 00:20:33,016
Yes...

261
00:20:33,061 --> 00:20:35,059
Where did those Shinobi come from?

262
00:20:36,016 --> 00:20:37,047
I don't know.

263
00:20:41,096 --> 00:20:43,072
The final day is approaching.

264
00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:46,075
You bastard.

265
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:52,002
Before that day,
I will come for you.

266
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,020
Hinata.

267
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,024
What is that?

268
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,082
W-what's going on?

269
00:21:51,096 --> 00:21:53,086
The Earth

270
00:21:56,005 --> 00:21:57,055
will be destroyed soon.

271
00:22:06,095 --> 00:22:08,001
Your mission is to

272
00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:10,081
rescue Hyuga Hanabi
who has been kidnapped.

273
00:22:10,081 --> 00:22:13,048
You'll be working as a four man team
led by Shikamaru.

274
00:22:13,048 --> 00:22:16,050
I'm also granting Hinata's request
to be included in this team.

275
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:18,026
Thank you very much.

276
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,092
Shikamaru, put your hand out.

277
00:22:20,094 --> 00:22:22,031
Why?

278
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:28,006
What is this?

279
00:22:28,007 --> 00:22:31,033
A top secret device that
only the Five Kage possess.

280
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:33,060
What kind of device is it?

281
00:22:33,074 --> 00:22:36,061
It's counting down the time until
Earth's destruction.

282
00:22:37,088 --> 00:22:39,048
I don't get it.

283
00:22:39,048 --> 00:22:42,046
Why is this necessary for Hanabi's rescue?

284
00:22:42,046 --> 00:22:44,046
Toneri, the one who kidnapped Hanabi,

285
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:46,052
could be the one manipulating the moon.

286
00:22:46,081 --> 00:22:48,023
What are you basing this on?

287
00:22:49,008 --> 00:22:51,054
My intuition.

288
00:22:56,062 --> 00:22:57,084
It was around here

289
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:59,099
that I lost sight of Hanabi's kidnapper.

290
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:02,069
Let's split up
and search for clues.

291
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,066
Naruto, take care of Hinata.

292
00:23:05,076 --> 00:23:06,079
Leave it to me!

293
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,034
What is it?

294
00:23:16,082 --> 00:23:18,053
Oh, nothing.

295
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:36,004
It's Hanabi's kunai.

296
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,075
You brought the scarf?

297
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:49,028
Why aren't you using it?
Aren't you cold?

298
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:51,097
I-I'm fine.

299
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:56,080
Anyway, we'd better hurry up and let Shikamaru
and the others know.

300
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:58,038
Oh yeah, you're right.

301
00:24:03,013 --> 00:24:05,075
What do you see, Hinata?

302
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:08,080
There's a spring that's glowing at the bottom of the cave.

303
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,061
A spring that's glowing?

304
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:14,033
That Shinobi letter is 'A'
as in 'Aun'.

305
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,073
It could mean
'This is the beginning'.

306
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,082
Hinata, what can you see at the
bottom of the spring?

307
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:21,069
My vision is distorted.

308
00:24:21,077 --> 00:24:23,077
Your Byakugan is distorting?

309
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:25,005
We'll just have to go down and see.

310
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:28,006
I can't get this wet.

311
00:24:28,006 --> 00:24:29,057
You're being so particular.

312
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,013
What's the big deal if your scarf gets wet?

313
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:34,079
It's a big deal.
This means a lot to me.

314
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:38,068
There's no need to worry.

315
00:24:39,035 --> 00:24:43,021
I touched the water and didn't get wet.

316
00:25:13,035 --> 00:25:16,097
If the world were to end tomorrow,

317
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,098
who would you like to spend
 your last day with?

318
00:25:18,098 --> 00:25:21,095
Like that would ever happen.

319
00:25:21,095 --> 00:25:23,053
Just suppose...

320
00:25:23,053 --> 00:25:25,042
The moon began to fall.

321
00:25:25,077 --> 00:25:27,068
If it's the end of the world,

322
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:30,052
I wish meat would fall instead of the moon!

323
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:36,080
Look, the moon.

324
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,077
The match up for the round seven...

325
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:54,049
Uzumaki Naruto vs.

326
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,000
Inuzuka Kiba.

327
00:25:57,009 --> 00:25:59,006
This is the chunin exam.

328
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:00,026
Naruto!

329
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:02,064
Don't you dare lose to a guy like him!

330
00:26:03,015 --> 00:26:06,068
- Ninja Art Beast Mimicry. All-Fours jutsu.

331
00:26:06,068 --> 00:26:07,086
Here I come.

332
00:26:10,086 --> 00:26:12,089
Stop it, Kiba.

333
00:26:16,068 --> 00:26:19,098
Naruto is fighting Pain right now.

334
00:26:21,004 --> 00:26:23,055
Naruto is fighting alone.

335
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:26,061
Banshō Ten'in.

336
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,046
Naruto...

337
00:26:43,097 --> 00:26:45,072
Naruto...

338
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,056
What is it?

339
00:26:48,058 --> 00:26:50,020
It's ointment.

340
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:52,036
Why are you giving this to me?

341
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,049
Just accept it, Naruto.

342
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:59,037
Thanks, you're a nice person Hinata.

343
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Banshō Ten'in.

344
00:27:18,097 --> 00:27:21,026
Soon I will take you with me.

345
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:29,068
Why'd you come out here?!

346
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:31,031
You're no match for him.

347
00:27:32,046 --> 00:27:33,088
This time,

348
00:27:33,088 --> 00:27:35,094
I'm going to save you, Naruto.

349
00:27:36,018 --> 00:27:39,087
I was always crying, and
giving up before even trying.

350
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:42,031
I made so many wrong turns.

351
00:27:43,055 --> 00:27:47,072
But Naruto, you helped me find my way
and take the correct path..

352
00:27:48,064 --> 00:27:51,088
I always chased after you,

353
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,056
I wanted to catch up to you,

354
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:58,021
I wanted to walk beside you all the time.

355
00:27:58,026 --> 00:28:00,051
I want to be at your side, always.

356
00:28:01,037 --> 00:28:03,096
You changed me, Naruto.

357
00:28:05,042 --> 00:28:08,062
Your smile is what saved me.

358
00:28:09,065 --> 00:28:12,065
That's why I'm not afraid to die,

359
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:15,031
If it means I can protect you!

360
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:25,030
That's because I love you, Naruto.

361
00:28:29,027 --> 00:28:30,097
Hinata...

362
00:28:31,006 --> 00:28:34,090
If the world were to end tomorrow,

363
00:28:34,096 --> 00:28:37,075
who would you like to spend your
last day with?

364
00:28:37,077 --> 00:28:39,080
If it's the end of the world,

365
00:28:39,082 --> 00:28:42,044
I wish meat would fall instead of the moon!

366
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,029
It's Iruka-sensei again, huh?

367
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:53,091
Write down who you'd want to spend
your last day on Earth with.

368
00:28:55,091 --> 00:28:57,040
Hey, Naruto!

369
00:28:57,042 --> 00:28:59,003
Don't throw away your paper!

370
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:02,098
But there's no way
the world's gonna end.

371
00:29:03,005 --> 00:29:05,097
I'm not saying it will, I'm just saying if it does!

372
00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:08,022
Well, it ain't gonna happen.

373
00:29:18,076 --> 00:29:21,092
Uzumaki Naruto.

374
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,036
Naruto...

375
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,042
What is it?

376
00:29:29,044 --> 00:29:30,081
It's ointment.

377
00:29:30,082 --> 00:29:32,039
Why are you giving this to me?

378
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:34,011
So dense.

379
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:37,024
He can be so dense.

380
00:29:37,033 --> 00:29:40,073
You were going to give him the scarf,
weren't you?

381
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,056
Yeah.

382
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:44,057
You can do it, Hinata.

383
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:46,049
Be confident!

384
00:29:46,056 --> 00:29:48,030
Thanks.

385
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,011
Naruto, I-

386
00:29:51,044 --> 00:29:53,006
You really love Ramen, don't you?

387
00:29:53,006 --> 00:29:54,098
Yup, I love it.

388
00:29:55,008 --> 00:29:57,069
Naruto, I-

389
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,022
Like, really love it.

390
00:29:59,058 --> 00:30:03,000
Yup, like that time Hinata said she loved me.

391
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,080
He's so dense.

392
00:30:04,086 --> 00:30:07,077
Maybe he doesn't know what love is?

393
00:30:07,082 --> 00:30:08,088
What do you mean?

394
00:30:08,088 --> 00:30:14,030
Like, knowing the difference between loving sweets
like chiratama dumpings and fruit gelatin and romantic love.

395
00:30:14,032 --> 00:30:15,082
They aren't the same?

396
00:30:19,043 --> 00:30:22,015
Hinata! Oh, you're such an idiot...

397
00:30:23,017 --> 00:30:25,011
Why'd you call me an idiot?

398
00:30:25,011 --> 00:30:27,048
Senpai, the gyoza are ready.

399
00:30:27,048 --> 00:30:28,046
Let's eat.

400
00:30:31,054 --> 00:30:33,018
- Oh.

401
00:30:31,054 --> 00:30:33,018
- Hinata!

402
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,061
Hinata!

403
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:58,009
Uzumaki Naruto.

404
00:30:59,044 --> 00:31:01,002
Hinata...

405
00:31:02,053 --> 00:31:04,068
That's why I'm not afraid to die,

406
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:07,029
If it means I can protect you.

407
00:31:09,031 --> 00:31:11,060
Because,

408
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:13,013
I love you, Naruto.

409
00:31:18,064 --> 00:31:19,064
Hinata...

410
00:31:22,098 --> 00:31:23,098
Naruto!

411
00:31:24,006 --> 00:31:25,043
Wake up!

412
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:26,068
This is a dream!

413
00:31:29,026 --> 00:31:31,013
Oh, Sakura.

414
00:31:31,073 --> 00:31:33,010
You're finally awake.

415
00:31:35,005 --> 00:31:37,044
Is this a trap set by the enemy?

416
00:31:37,053 --> 00:31:40,035
Yeah, it traps intruders in a genjutsu,

417
00:31:40,043 --> 00:31:42,060
and locks them away
in a world of memories.

418
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,066
It's a prison of caged memories.

419
00:31:44,091 --> 00:31:48,035
Thankfully Sakura who's resistant
to genjutsu was with us.

420
00:31:48,047 --> 00:31:49,046
Thanks, Sakura.

421
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:51,045
I was having a fun dream
of my brother.

422
00:31:51,046 --> 00:31:53,022
I appreciate you ripping me away from it.

423
00:31:53,022 --> 00:31:55,013
That doesn't sound like gratitude.

424
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:00,041
Another spring?

425
00:32:00,054 --> 00:32:02,060
Your Byakugan doesn't work here either, right?

426
00:32:02,091 --> 00:32:04,062
No, my sight is distorted.

427
00:32:04,071 --> 00:32:06,079
All right. As we proceed be prepared to fight.

428
00:32:06,082 --> 00:32:07,092
- Roger.

429
00:32:06,082 --> 00:32:07,092
- Roger.

430
00:32:14,008 --> 00:32:15,023
What's the matter?

431
00:32:15,096 --> 00:32:19,034
About those genjutsu dreams earlier...

432
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:21,079
What is it?

433
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:25,040
No, never mind.

434
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:35,089
Hinata...

435
00:32:37,066 --> 00:32:39,061
I said I'd come for you.

436
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,041
To take you away with me.

437
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:43,064
Where is Hanabi?

438
00:32:44,024 --> 00:32:48,044
Don't worry, she's fast asleep in my castle.

439
00:32:49,007 --> 00:32:50,035
Return Hanabi!

440
00:32:50,097 --> 00:32:52,082
That will all depend on your answer...

441
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:55,097
Byakugan Princess.

442
00:32:56,044 --> 00:32:58,040
'Byakugan Princess'?

443
00:32:59,053 --> 00:33:00,031
Hinata...

444
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,000
I...

445
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,031
...want you to marry me.

446
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,086
Marry you...?

447
00:33:18,055 --> 00:33:21,060
It's like a bubble factory.

448
00:33:22,081 --> 00:33:23,091
I get it.

449
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:28,048
This is where the gatekeeper
who made the bubbles lives.

450
00:33:28,076 --> 00:33:29,045
Gatekeeper?

451
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,010
Naruto and Hinata are taking their time...

452
00:33:33,007 --> 00:33:34,090
We should go back to check--

453
00:33:40,013 --> 00:33:41,044
A crab!?!

454
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,002
That's the gatekeeper.

455
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:49,041
Hinata!

456
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,056
Naruto!

457
00:33:51,077 --> 00:33:53,011
Get away from Hinata!

458
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:56,050
You again? You're in my way.

459
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,013
Move.

460
00:33:57,025 --> 00:33:58,077
Where is Hanabi?

461
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,078
Spread out!

462
00:34:05,023 --> 00:34:06,067
Don't destroy the bubbles,

463
00:34:06,071 --> 00:34:08,075
or we'll get caught in that genjutsu again!

464
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,085
Super Beast Scroll!

465
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,097
Fujin, Raijin!

466
00:34:47,091 --> 00:34:49,016
Perfect!

467
00:34:50,072 --> 00:34:51,088
Shadow Stitching!

468
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,073
Sakura!

469
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,068
Damn it!

470
00:35:33,086 --> 00:35:36,021
You're a puppet aren't you?

471
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,048
This is not my body.

472
00:35:43,009 --> 00:35:44,019
Hinata...

473
00:35:44,091 --> 00:35:47,084
Next time, the real me will come for you.

474
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,053
Give me an answer then.

475
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:52,077
Shut the hell up!

476
00:35:59,017 --> 00:36:03,073
Your fists won't ever touch me.

477
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:04,073
Not even close.

478
00:36:11,082 --> 00:36:14,059
Did you do this with a single punch, Sakura?

479
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,060
Of couse.

480
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:19,009
Naruto, if you leave Hinata behind
and expose her to danger again,

481
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:20,072
you'll get a taste of my fists too.

482
00:36:20,072 --> 00:36:22,043
I know.

483
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:25,013
Hinata, I'll never let--

484
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,094
I'll not let you out of my sight again.

485
00:36:29,096 --> 00:36:30,066
What is that?

486
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,055
You're already looking away!

487
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,011
I'm not looking away!

488
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,071
What is this place?

489
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:02,015
Is that island floting?

490
00:37:02,017 --> 00:37:03,017
No.

491
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:05,073
The surface of the oceans is warped.

492
00:37:06,066 --> 00:37:08,082
There's sunlight underground too.

493
00:37:09,004 --> 00:37:11,002
Isn't that artificial?

494
00:37:11,015 --> 00:37:12,055
A man-made sun?

495
00:37:12,072 --> 00:37:13,072
Yeah.

496
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,040
Hinata, any sign of the enemy?

497
00:37:22,063 --> 00:37:23,088
No, we're fine.

498
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:26,055
The enemy is aware of us.

499
00:37:26,057 --> 00:37:28,013
Why aren't they attacking?

500
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:30,069
Yeah, that bothers me too.

501
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,004
It's too quiet.

502
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,060
Leave them be.

503
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,053
Don't do anything
until I go to get her.

504
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:49,057
The eyes are twitching again!

505
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,030
Exquisite...

506
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,084
This Byakugan is very pure.

507
00:38:02,048 --> 00:38:04,000
Hinata?

508
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:17,008
That scarf... It was really for me?

509
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,053
I see a town about twenty kilometers ahead.

510
00:38:22,062 --> 00:38:23,082
All right, let's go.

511
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:39,062
It seems like it's deserted.

512
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:42,051
This town was built a few centuries ago.

513
00:38:42,051 --> 00:38:44,005
Let's split up and search.

514
00:38:49,034 --> 00:38:51,068
So it was a Shinobi village.

515
00:38:53,055 --> 00:38:54,070
A fire?

516
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,085
What is this?

517
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:04,008
Was there a war here long ago?

518
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,015
What's wrong, Hinata?

519
00:39:10,085 --> 00:39:12,017
There's a spider web.

520
00:39:13,075 --> 00:39:15,051
You can see so much with your Byakugan,

521
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:17,068
yet you walk straight
into a spider web.

522
00:39:17,069 --> 00:39:19,013
You're a silly one, huh?

523
00:39:26,084 --> 00:39:28,042
Naruto...

524
00:39:28,054 --> 00:39:29,058
What is it?

525
00:39:31,093 --> 00:39:33,005
Where is your scarf?

526
00:39:34,066 --> 00:39:38,004
It was pretty warm underground,
so I took it off.

527
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:40,060
I-I see.

528
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:44,022
I feel a bit cold myself.

529
00:39:44,033 --> 00:39:48,062
Well of course you are, dressed in clothing like that.

530
00:39:48,062 --> 00:39:50,097
It's just that this is my mission gear!

531
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:52,068
If you can take it,

532
00:39:52,072 --> 00:39:54,097
I can handle
a little cold like this.

533
00:39:57,054 --> 00:39:59,013
Are you okay?

534
00:39:59,084 --> 00:40:01,082
I'm totally fine.

535
00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:05,015
What?

536
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,068
It's nothing.

537
00:40:06,082 --> 00:40:07,077
What is it?

538
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,093
I said it's nothing!

539
00:40:09,097 --> 00:40:11,046
Come on, tell me.

540
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,061
That was good.

541
00:40:22,097 --> 00:40:24,026
Are you going somewhere?

542
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:25,062
I'm gonna take a leak.

543
00:40:32,011 --> 00:40:33,073
Naruto?!

544
00:40:36,002 --> 00:40:37,068
A spider web.

545
00:40:38,053 --> 00:40:39,071
You okay?

546
00:40:39,082 --> 00:40:40,060
Yeah.

547
00:40:41,008 --> 00:40:42,060
Ouch!

548
00:40:42,062 --> 00:40:43,082
What's wrong?

549
00:40:43,082 --> 00:40:46,017
I think I hurt my back.

550
00:40:48,076 --> 00:40:49,097
Thanks.

551
00:40:52,004 --> 00:40:55,017
You gave me some ointment back
during the Chunin exams, right?

552
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,026
You remembered that after all this time?

553
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:02,018
Actually, I only just remembered it.

554
00:41:23,082 --> 00:41:24,097
Thanks.

555
00:41:35,021 --> 00:41:37,088
We have to hurry and rescue Hanabi.

556
00:41:39,073 --> 00:41:42,047
Naruto, I'd like to talk
to you about something...

557
00:41:42,061 --> 00:41:43,061
What is it?

558
00:41:44,008 --> 00:41:47,089
About what was said when
that Toneri puppet appeared.

559
00:41:48,052 --> 00:41:49,052
Toneri?

560
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:51,072
Here they are!

561
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:55,088
Hinata, we need
you to check something.

562
00:41:56,072 --> 00:41:58,031
What does it say?

563
00:41:58,072 --> 00:42:00,049
It's some ancient writings.

564
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,082
'An ancient oath

565
00:42:02,082 --> 00:42:04,046
crossing the path of humanity.

566
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:05,053
Like all else,

567
00:42:06,007 --> 00:42:09,044
the Fist of the Tensei eye, 
the reborn moon,

568
00:42:09,044 --> 00:42:10,062
will destroy man'.

569
00:42:10,089 --> 00:42:12,001
What does that mean?

570
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,031
Maybe this 'Tensei eye'
is making the moon move?

571
00:42:15,086 --> 00:42:19,010
Maybe Hanabi's abduction is connected to the moon,

572
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,042
Just like Kakashi-sensei said.

573
00:42:20,043 --> 00:42:24,022
Well, his hunches are always spot on...

574
00:42:24,022 --> 00:42:25,022
Unfortunately.

575
00:42:26,025 --> 00:42:28,030
Byakugan Princess!

576
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:31,045
What is that?

577
00:42:45,085 --> 00:42:48,082
Is this a cemetery?

578
00:42:50,017 --> 00:42:51,022
What is this?

579
00:42:51,086 --> 00:42:53,009
Someone's here!

580
00:42:56,058 --> 00:43:01,004
Byakugan...
I sense the Byakugan.

581
00:43:01,054 --> 00:43:04,091
Oh, I'm certain of it!

582
00:43:05,091 --> 00:43:07,075
Oh, Byakugan Princess.

583
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:10,013
Stay away from Hinata!

584
00:43:36,037 --> 00:43:37,037
Hinata!

585
00:43:38,028 --> 00:43:39,093
What did you do to Hinata?!

586
00:43:41,094 --> 00:43:46,006
The Tenseigan has been revived.

587
00:43:49,016 --> 00:43:50,068
It must be stopped.

588
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:53,017
Otsutsuki's...

589
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,080
Hinata, are you all right?

590
00:43:59,015 --> 00:44:00,015
Y-yes.

591
00:44:00,023 --> 00:44:02,094
That man said something like 'Otsutsuki'...

592
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:05,078
That's the original surname of 
the Sage of Six Paths.

593
00:44:06,073 --> 00:44:08,011
Hagoromo Otsutsuki...

594
00:44:08,011 --> 00:44:09,097
That was the name of Sage of the Six Paths

595
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,082
before he entered the priesthood.

596
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:14,035
He called
Hinata 'Byakugan Princess'.

597
00:44:15,012 --> 00:44:18,075
Seems Toneri's abduction of Hanabi is connected.

598
00:44:27,091 --> 00:44:29,008
Knitting again...

599
00:44:29,063 --> 00:44:31,094
Is she going to keep knitting forever?

600
00:44:32,063 --> 00:44:35,009
I guess it takes a lot of time.

601
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:39,071
Hinata, what was it that
you wanted to talk about earlier?

602
00:44:42,057 --> 00:44:45,074
You mentioned something about
what Toneri's puppet said?

603
00:44:46,011 --> 00:44:49,044
Oh, that. It was nothing.

604
00:44:49,056 --> 00:44:53,000
What do you mean nothing?

605
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:58,031
I'm sorry, I'd like to be alone.

606
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:04,067
I see.

607
00:45:26,054 --> 00:45:28,026
Let's check out that village.

608
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:52,040
Seems like Hanabi's not here either.

609
00:46:17,075 --> 00:46:20,053
We should head back and rejoin the others.

610
00:46:21,026 --> 00:46:22,030
Yeah.

611
00:47:03,062 --> 00:47:04,086
Hinata.

612
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,084
My little sister is in so much danger,

613
00:47:07,084 --> 00:47:09,025
and here I am knitting.

614
00:47:09,025 --> 00:47:11,040
I'm a terrible big sister, aren't I?

615
00:47:11,097 --> 00:47:13,064
That's not true,

616
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:17,078
you came all this way
to save your sister, didn't you?

617
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
If only I'd stayed home that night--

618
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,050
I swear I'll rescue Hanabi!

619
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,033
You don't need to worry.

620
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:28,022
Thank you.

621
00:47:28,022 --> 00:47:31,021
You're so kind, Naruto.

622
00:47:33,076 --> 00:47:38,020
Hey, I'm not just being kind
because I'm in love with you or anything.

623
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,052
I'm just worried about Hanabi.

624
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:43,016
What was that?

625
00:47:43,016 --> 00:47:44,093
What did you just say?

626
00:47:46,021 --> 00:47:48,046
I'm worried about Hanabi.

627
00:47:50,002 --> 00:47:52,035
Not that...

628
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,010
Not that...?

629
00:48:00,051 --> 00:48:01,053
Hinata...

630
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,004
I...

631
00:48:07,004 --> 00:48:09,004
I love you.

632
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,017
Hinata?

633
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:47,060
Toneri, are you another puppet?

634
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,062
Where is Hanabi?

635
00:48:49,064 --> 00:48:50,063
Silence.

636
00:48:50,063 --> 00:48:53,048
I came to hear Hinata's answer.

637
00:48:53,048 --> 00:48:57,028
Answer? Hinata has nothing to say to you.

638
00:48:57,035 --> 00:48:58,095
So where is Hanabi?

639
00:49:00,087 --> 00:49:01,080
Hinata.

640
00:49:05,066 --> 00:49:06,040
Hey!

641
00:49:07,013 --> 00:49:09,064
Hinata what's going on?

642
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,020
Goodbye.

643
00:49:42,085 --> 00:49:44,011
Hinata!

644
00:50:06,066 --> 00:50:08,097
Give Hinata back!

645
00:50:08,097 --> 00:50:10,064
'Give her back'?

646
00:50:11,055 --> 00:50:14,032
Hinata came to me willingly.

647
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:18,038
This has been destined since ancient times.

648
00:50:18,062 --> 00:50:20,060
Hinata and I shall be wed.

649
00:50:20,068 --> 00:50:21,095
Wed?

650
00:50:22,097 --> 00:50:23,091
Hinata...

651
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,008
That's a lie, right?

652
00:50:46,016 --> 00:50:47,053
My chakra is...

653
00:51:12,077 --> 00:51:14,022
What are you doing?!

654
00:51:14,022 --> 00:51:16,040
I didn't want to get into a petty fight

655
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,000
and risk getting you hurt.

656
00:51:51,095 --> 00:51:53,013
Hinata...

657
00:52:13,038 --> 00:52:15,006
Hurry up and go!

658
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,046
I can't go any further!

659
00:52:16,046 --> 00:52:18,002
Hey, stay in the line!

660
00:52:18,002 --> 00:52:19,022
Don't panic!

661
00:52:19,022 --> 00:52:21,040
The Air-raid shelters were constructed

662
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,020
to accommodate every citizen in the Land of Fire.

663
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:29,004
Keep calm. Please keep calm.

664
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,017
Water Style: Water Dragon jutsu.

665
00:52:35,093 --> 00:52:38,002
Lava style: Lava Monster jutsu.

666
00:52:40,098 --> 00:52:43,091
Particle Style: Atomic Dismantling jutsu.

667
00:52:50,023 --> 00:52:52,044
Damn it, my back!

668
00:53:00,046 --> 00:53:02,035
So this place is the moon?

669
00:53:02,035 --> 00:53:03,022
Yeah.

670
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:05,053
That place we encountered the crab bubbles may be a conduit.

671
00:53:05,053 --> 00:53:09,000
A passageway connecting the Earth to the moon.

672
00:53:12,051 --> 00:53:13,088
How is Naruto doing?

673
00:53:14,004 --> 00:53:15,000
It's bad.

674
00:53:15,015 --> 00:53:17,039
He's been almost completely drained of chakra.

675
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,080
Hinata...

676
00:53:24,053 --> 00:53:28,051
So you finally get it, you blockhead.

677
00:53:34,024 --> 00:53:35,042
So beautiful...

678
00:53:36,085 --> 00:53:40,066
Hinata, I want to know more about you.

679
00:53:47,088 --> 00:53:49,057
Why this guy...?

680
00:53:57,035 --> 00:53:59,051
This place is...

681
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:12,048
Toneri's castle?

682
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,033
Hanabi!

683
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:33,017
Her eyes have been removed.

684
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:37,007
Hinata...

685
00:54:39,076 --> 00:54:41,007
...want you to marry me.

686
00:54:42,055 --> 00:54:43,055
Marry you...?

687
00:54:43,095 --> 00:54:45,020
What are you saying?!

688
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,000
Let Hanabi--

689
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,090
Your sister is in my castle.

690
00:54:50,096 --> 00:54:52,037
Hanabi!

691
00:54:54,088 --> 00:54:57,063
I've taken her Byakugan for my own.

692
00:54:59,025 --> 00:55:00,060
You're terrible.

693
00:55:01,036 --> 00:55:02,028
I'm sorry.

694
00:55:02,068 --> 00:55:04,050
It's all part of Hamura's celestial decree.

695
00:55:04,057 --> 00:55:05,067
Hamura?

696
00:55:05,081 --> 00:55:09,014
The founder of the Shinobi of the Moon.
Otsutsuki Hamura.

697
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:11,050
Perhaps you will understand if I said he was

698
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:15,058
the younger brother of The Sage of the Six Paths.
 Founder of the Shinobi of Earth.

699
00:55:15,058 --> 00:55:19,029
Your Hyuga clan are inheritors of
Hamura's bloodline.

700
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:25,029
The story goes back many eons.
Several millennia, in fact.

701
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:29,026
The Sage of the Six Paths, the elder brother, 
had some misgivings.

702
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:31,096
He feared that the Ten Tails,

703
00:55:31,096 --> 00:55:34,095
with its massive chakra
and immeasurable power,

704
00:55:34,095 --> 00:55:37,063
would bring calamity to the world.

705
00:55:38,062 --> 00:55:42,068
So the Sage of the Six Paths extracted
the Ten Tail's chakra

706
00:55:42,068 --> 00:55:46,037
and divided it among nine tailed beasts
in order to weaken its power.

707
00:55:46,044 --> 00:55:49,051
The husk of the Ten Tails
whose chakra was extracted,

708
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:52,059
namely the Gedo Statue, was hidden
 and sealed away on the moon.

709
00:55:53,045 --> 00:55:56,068
In order to prevent the Ten Tails from being revived,

710
00:55:57,089 --> 00:56:00,015
Hamura decided to live on the moon

711
00:56:00,015 --> 00:56:02,005
and guard the Gedo Statue.

712
00:56:03,034 --> 00:56:06,066
The Sage of the Six Paths however, became the
founder of the Shinobi on Earth.

713
00:56:07,095 --> 00:56:11,020
But Hamura was skeptical of the world that his

714
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,014
older brother was creating.

715
00:56:13,045 --> 00:56:18,094
He decided that if the world created by his brother
went astray from the path of Shinobi,

716
00:56:18,094 --> 00:56:22,062
He would entrust his descendants with ensuring its destruction.

717
00:56:24,021 --> 00:56:26,097
Throughout the millennia that have passed,

718
00:56:26,098 --> 00:56:29,051
fighting between the Shinobi on Earth has not ceased.

719
00:56:29,062 --> 00:56:32,016
They continue to use
chakra as a weapon,

720
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:35,093
and ultimately, even the Gedo Statue was stolen

721
00:56:35,093 --> 00:56:37,069
and the Ten Tails was revived.

722
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:41,062
Our clan then reached the conclusion

723
00:56:41,066 --> 00:56:45,048
that the Shinobi of Earth only serve to destroy
the world's peace and order.

724
00:56:46,046 --> 00:56:49,083
The world that The Sage of the Six Paths 
created was deemed a failure.

725
00:56:50,098 --> 00:56:53,082
So in accordance with the celestial decree of Hamura,

726
00:56:53,082 --> 00:56:56,066
I will destroy the world 
made by The Sage of the Six Paths.

727
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:02,005
When this pure Byakugan
synergizes with my chakra,

728
00:57:03,005 --> 00:57:05,000
it will transform into the Tenseigan.

729
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:09,014
With its visual prowess
I will gather up the ashes of the Earth

730
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:11,051
and create a completely new world.

731
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,034
I don't believe your story,

732
00:57:13,034 --> 00:57:15,024
and I'm going to rescue Hanabi!

733
00:57:15,093 --> 00:57:19,004
Despite having no notion of
where this castle is located?

734
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:24,002
I'll return for your answer.

735
00:57:25,099 --> 00:57:27,009
Hinata!

736
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:35,060
Good morning.

737
00:57:38,068 --> 00:57:42,044
I'm happy that you accepted my feelings, Hinata.

738
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:50,024
Lady Hinata, welcome to the castle.

739
00:57:50,024 --> 00:57:51,053
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

740
00:57:51,053 --> 00:57:53,093
There are only puppets in this castle, then?

741
00:57:54,027 --> 00:57:57,060
They're marionettes left here by our ancestors.

742
00:57:58,035 --> 00:58:00,080
Since my father died
when I was young,

743
00:58:01,015 --> 00:58:04,051
I have lived alone in the castle.

744
00:58:07,046 --> 00:58:09,097
We will hold the marriage ceremony here.

745
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:13,035
Then we will enter the Room of Rebirth

746
00:58:13,035 --> 00:58:15,015
and fall into a deep slumber

747
00:58:15,015 --> 00:58:18,006
until the Earth stabilizes after
its destruction.

748
00:58:18,008 --> 00:58:19,020
That's impossible.

749
00:58:19,025 --> 00:58:21,024
The moon will also be destroyed!

750
00:58:21,024 --> 00:58:25,032
Don't worry. This castle is protected
by an immense chakra.

751
00:58:25,049 --> 00:58:27,018
An immense chakra?

752
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:29,055
Yes, strong enough to move the moon.

753
00:58:29,055 --> 00:58:30,078
What do you mean?

754
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:34,013
It's the power
of Otsutsuki's treasure,

755
00:58:34,075 --> 00:58:36,048
honed from the suffering of my clan.

756
00:58:36,048 --> 00:58:39,095
Where would such a thing be?

757
00:58:42,062 --> 00:58:43,084
That is...

758
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:48,086
Something I cannot reveal.

759
00:58:52,011 --> 00:58:56,022
May I return to my room?
It's cold outside.

760
00:58:57,018 --> 00:58:59,088
That's because it's dusk here all year.

761
00:59:01,048 --> 00:59:03,003
Oh, that's right.

762
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:06,000
Will you knit me a scarf?

763
00:59:08,012 --> 00:59:10,046
A scarf just for me.

764
00:59:13,086 --> 00:59:15,002
Do you refuse?

765
00:59:16,062 --> 00:59:18,000
I understand.

766
00:59:18,037 --> 00:59:20,068
Really? Thank you.

767
00:59:21,018 --> 00:59:23,060
You've made me happy, Hinata.

768
00:59:28,056 --> 00:59:30,000
What's wrong?

769
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,059
Don't worry.

770
00:59:32,073 --> 00:59:36,015
It's proof that the Byakugan is maturing
into the Tenseigan.

771
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,097
It will subside with a little rest.

772
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,066
It doesn't seem to be here.

773
00:59:49,004 --> 00:59:51,011
Byakugan Princess.

774
01:00:20,037 --> 01:00:22,068
Activate the Tenseigan!

775
01:01:00,051 --> 01:01:03,074
We are descendants of Hamura.

776
01:01:03,074 --> 01:01:06,072
We belong to the main family
of the Otsutsuki clan.

777
01:01:06,074 --> 01:01:09,081
We were annihilated by the branch family,

778
01:01:09,081 --> 01:01:13,051
who have twisted the interpretation of
Hamura's celestial decree.

779
01:01:13,061 --> 01:01:18,015
Toneri, a descendant of the branch family
is attempting to make the moon

780
01:01:18,016 --> 01:01:21,085
fall into the Earth by
using the power of the Tenseigan.

781
01:01:22,007 --> 01:01:30,024
Only you can
destroy the Tenseigan, Byakugan Princess.

782
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:46,040
You are...

783
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:49,064
Otsutsuki Hamura.

784
01:01:53,011 --> 01:01:55,040
Byakugan Princess.

785
01:01:56,002 --> 01:02:01,021
Do not let the world my
elder brother created come to an end.

786
01:02:08,093 --> 01:02:11,088
Hanabi, you poor thing.

787
01:02:13,098 --> 01:02:18,013
I'll definitely find and destroy the Tenseigan.

788
01:02:20,086 --> 01:02:22,046
I can't believe that.

789
01:02:22,046 --> 01:02:24,071
Toneri has been hiding in the artificial sun.

790
01:02:24,071 --> 01:02:28,013
Why wasn't Hinata's Byakugan able to discover it?

791
01:02:28,021 --> 01:02:32,035
Maybe he has a jutsu on the artificial moon
that deflects the Byakugan too?

792
01:02:33,004 --> 01:02:34,034
Where's the entrance?

793
01:02:34,081 --> 01:02:37,010
Why don't we ask them?

794
01:02:41,086 --> 01:02:43,027
What are you doing?

795
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,080
You've alerted the enemy!

796
01:02:44,085 --> 01:02:46,003
Follow me.

797
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:48,002
What are you doing?

798
01:02:48,006 --> 01:02:49,021
I'll explain later!

799
01:03:02,034 --> 01:03:03,080
So that's how it is.

800
01:03:04,065 --> 01:03:06,013
Sai, retreat.

801
01:03:18,017 --> 01:03:20,011
Super Beast Scroll!

802
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:32,031
I never imagined this guy's debut
would come after the war

803
01:03:32,034 --> 01:03:34,014
with the world being at peace.

804
01:03:35,038 --> 01:03:37,088
Below is the Chakra Diffusion Cannon.

805
01:03:38,056 --> 01:03:42,025
We'll blast all the meteorites
above the equator.

806
01:03:42,074 --> 01:03:45,041
On top is the Chakra Transportation Cannon.

807
01:03:45,045 --> 01:03:48,057
It can transport any
target into another dimension.

808
01:03:48,071 --> 01:03:51,053
With these, we'll destroy the moon.

809
01:03:51,053 --> 01:03:54,068
Everyone, get the cannons ready immediately!

810
01:04:00,093 --> 01:04:03,062
Meals are nice when you have someone to talk to.

811
01:04:05,077 --> 01:04:08,084
Now tell me all about yourself.

812
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:14,019
It's not too late to negotiate
with the Shinobi on Earth.

813
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,063
What?

814
01:04:15,065 --> 01:04:16,063
You're right...

815
01:04:16,063 --> 01:04:18,085
The Shinobi on Earth have used chakra

816
01:04:18,085 --> 01:04:20,071
and continued fighting.

817
01:04:20,071 --> 01:04:22,091
But it's different now.

818
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:25,055
In order to protect this hard-won peace

819
01:04:25,055 --> 01:04:27,040
Shinobi have joined together.

820
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,038
So...

821
01:04:28,039 --> 01:04:30,067
They will start another war.

822
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:33,088
The Sage of the Six Paths' world must be destroyed.

823
01:04:34,021 --> 01:04:35,021
But...

824
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:38,097
Never bring that subject up again!

825
01:04:39,034 --> 01:04:41,047
Now be quiet and eat.

826
01:04:50,044 --> 01:04:51,072
That island...

827
01:04:52,033 --> 01:04:53,077
So it's appeared already.

828
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:56,066
That is the Temple of Hamura.

829
01:04:56,084 --> 01:05:01,073
Once a year, during the Rebirth Festival,
it passes close to the castle.

830
01:05:06,094 --> 01:05:09,000
There's no doubt about it.

831
01:05:10,009 --> 01:05:13,041
The Tenseigan is hidden on that island.

832
01:05:18,021 --> 01:05:19,045
Naruto...

833
01:05:20,021 --> 01:05:21,024
Goodbye.

834
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,002
Hinata...

835
01:05:26,001 --> 01:05:27,001
Hinata!

836
01:05:27,063 --> 01:05:28,099
So you're finally awake?

837
01:05:29,067 --> 01:05:30,092
Finally?

838
01:05:31,075 --> 01:05:33,003
It's been three days.

839
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:37,015
Did something happen between you and Hinata?

840
01:05:37,068 --> 01:05:39,066
No, not really.

841
01:05:40,047 --> 01:05:43,003
You kept groaning her name.
Hinata, Hinata.

842
01:05:43,092 --> 01:05:46,024
As well as some other embarrassing things.

843
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:50,002
But I got to listen in on
your mushy side.

844
01:05:50,002 --> 01:05:52,019
It was great research material for me.

845
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,001
Hey...

846
01:05:56,051 --> 01:05:57,080
Naruto.

847
01:05:57,081 --> 01:05:59,089
Let's go rescue Hinata and Hanabi.

848
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:05,033
Is it hard to face the woman
who rejected you?

849
01:06:05,033 --> 01:06:09,049
So Naruto is strong as a Shinobi
but can't handle a broken heart?

850
01:06:09,086 --> 01:06:11,020
Now I know your weakness.

851
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:12,030
Hey!

852
01:06:16,088 --> 01:06:21,048
Hamura must be happy that you
personally want to pay homage.

853
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:31,047
The Tenseigan is inside here.

854
01:06:46,018 --> 01:06:47,098
This is...

855
01:06:48,001 --> 01:06:49,039
The Tenseigan.

856
01:06:49,043 --> 01:06:53,009
Then this is Otsutsuki's treasure
that is moving the moon?

857
01:06:54,078 --> 01:06:57,082
Lady Hinata, only those those
of exalted status

858
01:06:57,082 --> 01:07:00,074
are allowed to see the real Tenseigan.

859
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:05,023
This is a temple where those
of lower rank come to pray.

860
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:08,013
I see.

861
01:07:11,067 --> 01:07:16,003
I shall show you the real Tenseigan
after we are married.

862
01:07:29,027 --> 01:07:32,016
My field of vision distorts
at only that spot.

863
01:07:33,035 --> 01:07:35,033
So that's it. I've got it!

864
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:42,002
How long are you going to be like this?

865
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:49,085
Well you gave up on a woman,

866
01:07:49,086 --> 01:07:52,028
so why not give up
on becoming Hokage too?

867
01:07:53,061 --> 01:07:54,099
Yeah, just it give up.

868
01:07:55,006 --> 01:07:57,056
Give up on the woman
and give up on becoming Hokage.

869
01:07:57,061 --> 01:07:59,026
What was that, Shikamaru?

870
01:07:59,044 --> 01:08:00,098
Are you trying to pick a fight?

871
01:08:00,098 --> 01:08:03,071
I don't care what
happens between you and Hinata.

872
01:08:03,072 --> 01:08:05,022
But you're a Shinobi!

873
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:08,065
Come with me.

874
01:08:22,018 --> 01:08:24,017
I'm going to my room to rest.

875
01:08:24,073 --> 01:08:27,076
I'm looking forward to the finished scarf.

876
01:08:44,049 --> 01:08:46,081
I feel it. I can feel it.

877
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:49,051
The beating in my eyes!

878
01:08:51,022 --> 01:08:52,092
It will be born very soon.

879
01:08:53,093 --> 01:08:55,086
The complete Tenseigan.

880
01:09:04,064 --> 01:09:05,064
Sakura...

881
01:09:05,095 --> 01:09:09,060
This is the result of infusing nearly
every ounce of her chakra into you

882
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:11,084
trying to keep you alive.

883
01:09:12,055 --> 01:09:13,054
Sakura!

884
01:09:17,033 --> 01:09:18,033
Naruto.

885
01:09:18,033 --> 01:09:20,042
Sakura, I'm so sorry.

886
01:09:20,066 --> 01:09:24,003
Are you going to depend on Sakura
to heal not only his body,

887
01:09:24,011 --> 01:09:25,071
but his heart as well?

888
01:09:25,074 --> 01:09:27,091
Can you do it?

889
01:09:29,037 --> 01:09:30,075
You have a point.

890
01:09:34,026 --> 01:09:35,036
I see.

891
01:09:35,072 --> 01:09:39,075
I never imagined you'd confess your love first.

892
01:09:40,031 --> 01:09:45,060
Remember long ago, when you
said you loved me?

893
01:09:47,024 --> 01:09:51,070
But wasn't that
because I loved Sasuke?

894
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,024
You didn't want to lose to him.

895
01:09:57,048 --> 01:09:59,066
But it's the real thing this time, isn't it?

896
01:10:00,006 --> 01:10:02,013
Hinata is a great person.

897
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,075
She's almost too good for you.

898
01:10:05,069 --> 01:10:08,020
But it's over.

899
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:11,040
Hinata went to Toneri.

900
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,004
You're so stupid.

901
01:10:13,004 --> 01:10:16,034
It's obvious she had a reason
that she couldn't reveal.

902
01:10:17,078 --> 01:10:20,081
When a girl truly falls in love,

903
01:10:20,081 --> 01:10:23,055
her feelings don't change that easily.

904
01:10:24,042 --> 01:10:25,082
They can't change.

905
01:10:26,031 --> 01:10:30,008
I understand how she feels
very well.

906
01:11:02,002 --> 01:11:03,040
This is...

907
01:11:06,074 --> 01:11:08,031
Tenseigan.

908
01:11:16,013 --> 01:11:18,026
I'll stop the moon!

909
01:11:43,001 --> 01:11:44,086
What's the meaning of this?

910
01:11:44,086 --> 01:11:46,062
You're wrong!

911
01:11:47,029 --> 01:11:48,042
What?

912
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:52,031
Hamura's soul entrusted me with the true celestial decree.

913
01:11:52,031 --> 01:11:56,002
You have distorted Hamura's teachings.

914
01:11:56,002 --> 01:11:58,095
Hamura never wished for the destruction of Earth...

915
01:11:58,096 --> 01:12:01,066
The Sage of Six Path's world!

916
01:12:03,077 --> 01:12:06,071
You've betrayed me.

917
01:12:08,026 --> 01:12:10,015
Please hear me out!
Hamura is...

918
01:12:10,018 --> 01:12:11,044
Silence! They're lies.

919
01:12:11,046 --> 01:12:13,046
I don't believe it.

920
01:12:13,057 --> 01:12:16,041
There is only one celestial decree that Hamura made,

921
01:12:16,042 --> 01:12:19,006
and that is to end the world,
of the Sage of Six Paths!

922
01:12:19,015 --> 01:12:20,015
Damn it!

923
01:12:20,028 --> 01:12:22,013
So you were knitting this

924
01:12:22,013 --> 01:12:24,007
for him and not for me?

925
01:12:35,013 --> 01:12:37,064
I'm going to make it so
you'll never betray me

926
01:12:38,068 --> 01:12:40,030
ever again!

927
01:12:43,008 --> 01:12:44,035
Hinata...

928
01:12:45,008 --> 01:12:48,053
This big idiot finally understands,

929
01:12:49,055 --> 01:12:55,024
the meaning of the scarf you gave me
when you went to Toneri.

930
01:12:56,093 --> 01:13:00,068
I know now, from the scarf you painstakingly knitted,

931
01:13:00,068 --> 01:13:02,062
and took so long to finish,

932
01:13:02,062 --> 01:13:06,055
that your love can't be unraveled so easily.

933
01:13:15,003 --> 01:13:16,031
Naruto...

934
01:13:18,047 --> 01:13:20,042
Wait for me.

935
01:13:20,055 --> 01:13:25,062
You've loved
someone like me all this time.

936
01:13:25,062 --> 01:13:29,040
Now, as a man,
there's something I've got to say to you.

937
01:13:35,013 --> 01:13:39,033
Hinata, I swear I'll save you!

938
01:14:22,054 --> 01:14:25,064
Lord Raikage, the Chakra Cannons are ready.

939
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:29,020
All right. Men, load the chakra.

940
01:14:29,021 --> 01:14:30,022
- Yes sir.
- Yes sir.

941
01:14:30,022 --> 01:14:33,042
First, we'll fire the Chakra Diffusion Cannon
to pulverize the meteorites.

942
01:14:33,046 --> 01:14:35,066
Pulverize. Powderize!

943
01:15:02,001 --> 01:15:03,025
Cover me!

944
01:15:03,025 --> 01:15:04,005
Right!

945
01:15:04,029 --> 01:15:05,066
Rasen Shuriken!

946
01:15:11,021 --> 01:15:12,053
Shadow Paralysis jutsu!

947
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:19,006
Next...

948
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:22,064
We're storming the castle!

949
01:15:22,075 --> 01:15:23,075
Right!

950
01:15:31,043 --> 01:15:32,053
Sakura!

951
01:15:41,008 --> 01:15:42,061
Thanks, Naruto.

952
01:15:42,062 --> 01:15:44,039
No need to thank me.

953
01:15:44,055 --> 01:15:47,061
I owe a debt to you that
I'll never be able to repay.

954
01:15:53,032 --> 01:15:55,016
What a pain.

955
01:15:57,061 --> 01:15:58,074
Why are you hiding it?

956
01:15:58,082 --> 01:16:02,038
It's irritating, and it's clouding my judgement.

957
01:16:06,072 --> 01:16:09,042
Naruto, can you sense Hanabi's chakra?

958
01:16:12,066 --> 01:16:14,060
Hanabi is in that tower over there.

959
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:16,082
Sakura, Sai...
Take care of Hanabi.

960
01:16:16,084 --> 01:16:17,069
- Right!

961
01:16:16,084 --> 01:16:17,069
- Right!

962
01:16:46,042 --> 01:16:48,024
Hinata!

963
01:16:48,045 --> 01:16:49,075
You bastard!

964
01:16:56,085 --> 01:16:59,040
Your fists won't ever touch me.

965
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:03,046
Naruto, where's Hinata?

966
01:17:03,046 --> 01:17:04,073
In there!

967
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:08,077
I'll handle things here.

968
01:17:08,077 --> 01:17:09,075
Thanks.

969
01:17:12,056 --> 01:17:13,075
Move!

970
01:17:17,016 --> 01:17:19,088
I won't let you pass.

971
01:17:19,091 --> 01:17:22,082
All right, the puppet show begins now.

972
01:17:25,038 --> 01:17:27,002
Hanabi is above here.

973
01:17:31,071 --> 01:17:32,066
What?

974
01:17:39,046 --> 01:17:40,061
This way!

975
01:17:42,016 --> 01:17:43,016
Hinata...

976
01:17:51,084 --> 01:17:54,006
Wind Style: Sky Sand Defensive Wall.

977
01:18:04,014 --> 01:18:06,042
At six o'clock! It's a huge one!

978
01:18:06,042 --> 01:18:08,053
Everyone!
Crane wing formation!

979
01:18:08,053 --> 01:18:09,096
- Roger!
- Roger!

980
01:18:19,024 --> 01:18:21,055
The Sixth Gate Of Joy!

981
01:18:25,028 --> 01:18:26,069
Damn it!

982
01:18:45,042 --> 01:18:46,057
You're...!

983
01:18:48,048 --> 01:18:50,011
If he's not around,

984
01:18:50,076 --> 01:18:52,060
The only one who 
can protect the village

985
01:18:53,015 --> 01:18:54,055
is me.

986
01:18:57,046 --> 01:18:58,073
Sasuke.

987
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:01,008
The meteorites are gone.

988
01:19:01,042 --> 01:19:02,053
Lord Hokage.

989
01:19:02,058 --> 01:19:03,058
What is it?

990
01:19:05,051 --> 01:19:06,051
Hiashi?

991
01:19:07,077 --> 01:19:10,006
Chakra capacity at 75%

992
01:19:11,029 --> 01:19:13,079
76, 77...

993
01:19:17,045 --> 01:19:19,012
One after the other.

994
01:19:28,075 --> 01:19:30,066
Now, go in.

995
01:19:33,008 --> 01:19:34,013
Hinata!

996
01:19:34,084 --> 01:19:36,048
What did you do?

997
01:19:36,048 --> 01:19:37,082
Give Hinata back!

998
01:19:37,082 --> 01:19:41,013
Fine, I'll give her back.

999
01:19:47,095 --> 01:19:49,073
Stop, Hinata!

1000
01:19:50,086 --> 01:19:54,017
What do you think of my wife's skills?

1001
01:19:54,062 --> 01:19:55,086
Damn it!

1002
01:19:58,036 --> 01:20:00,044
He's controlling her.

1003
01:20:02,088 --> 01:20:03,093
Hinata...

1004
01:20:03,093 --> 01:20:06,017
Bear with it for just a moment.

1005
01:20:16,055 --> 01:20:19,068
Hinata isn't a doll for you to manipulate!

1006
01:20:20,043 --> 01:20:24,015
Hinata belongs to me.
I'm taking her back.

1007
01:20:28,037 --> 01:20:29,064
Hinata...

1008
01:20:30,006 --> 01:20:31,042
Get back.

1009
01:20:42,062 --> 01:20:44,071
It's too early for you to wake up.

1010
01:20:49,024 --> 01:20:51,031
Damn, the final pulsation!

1011
01:20:59,055 --> 01:21:01,004
Naruto!

1012
01:21:01,004 --> 01:21:02,026
Hinata!

1013
01:21:02,056 --> 01:21:05,050
Naruto, I'm so sorry...

1014
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:06,026
I...

1015
01:21:06,026 --> 01:21:08,086
I understand,
you don't need to say anything.

1016
01:21:08,086 --> 01:21:11,000
I'm the one who has to apologize.

1017
01:21:11,046 --> 01:21:12,088
But what about him?

1018
01:21:12,088 --> 01:21:14,017
Now's our chance,

1019
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:16,026
we have to destroy the Tenseigan!

1020
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:17,086
Tenseigan?

1021
01:21:23,026 --> 01:21:24,026
Hanabi!

1022
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:26,071
How terrible.

1023
01:21:26,071 --> 01:21:28,013
She's just a child.

1024
01:21:35,037 --> 01:21:36,042
Hinata...

1025
01:21:39,077 --> 01:21:43,011
If we destroy this the moon
should stop its approach.

1026
01:21:43,011 --> 01:21:45,057
Got it. I'll use my Rasengan.

1027
01:21:45,057 --> 01:21:46,022
No!

1028
01:21:46,082 --> 01:21:49,043
There is a cursed jutsu cast upon this eye.

1029
01:21:49,044 --> 01:21:52,033
Only someone of Hamura's bloodline
can touch it.

1030
01:21:52,033 --> 01:21:54,000
Anyone else will be completely drained of their chakra.

1031
01:22:03,052 --> 01:22:06,028
Eight Trigrams: Twin Lion Shot

1032
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:22,066
I can't destroy it!

1033
01:22:29,013 --> 01:22:32,008
Hinata, infuse me with your chakra.

1034
01:22:33,015 --> 01:22:36,063
Then together we might be able to break it apart.

1035
01:22:38,093 --> 01:22:39,066
Okay.

1036
01:22:43,084 --> 01:22:45,010
Let's go.

1037
01:22:45,042 --> 01:22:46,024
Okay.

1038
01:23:15,052 --> 01:23:16,052
These are...

1039
01:23:16,073 --> 01:23:20,094
The Tenseigan was made out of clusters of Byakugan?

1040
01:23:40,012 --> 01:23:41,081
What?

1041
01:24:02,026 --> 01:24:03,055
Lord Hokage,

1042
01:24:03,055 --> 01:24:05,035
the moon has stopped its approach.

1043
01:24:05,044 --> 01:24:06,054
What?

1044
01:24:09,029 --> 01:24:11,096
Chakra capacity at 95%

1045
01:24:12,042 --> 01:24:17,007
96, 97, 98, 99...

1046
01:24:18,007 --> 01:24:20,027
Chakra is at 100%

1047
01:24:20,031 --> 01:24:22,062
Chakra Diffusion Cannon
fire!

1048
01:24:22,065 --> 01:24:23,087
Yeah!

1049
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:49,036
What just happened?

1050
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:52,023
An urgent message from the Cloud Village,

1051
01:24:52,023 --> 01:24:54,022
a Five Kage summit is being convened.

1052
01:24:54,064 --> 01:24:57,018
All the meteorites have been destroyed.

1053
01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:59,060
So you had such a weapon like that
hidden away?

1054
01:24:59,061 --> 01:25:02,037
It seems we can not be
too careful with you, Raikage.

1055
01:25:02,038 --> 01:25:04,082
Lord Tsuchikage, let's drop the sarcasm!

1056
01:25:04,082 --> 01:25:07,033
Next up is the
Chakra Transportation Cannon.

1057
01:25:07,043 --> 01:25:09,010
We'll blow up the moon!

1058
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:10,060
Blow up the moon?

1059
01:25:15,098 --> 01:25:17,041
What's happening?

1060
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:19,027
Shikamaru!

1061
01:25:20,021 --> 01:25:22,064
Hinata, are you all right?

1062
01:25:23,016 --> 01:25:25,051
Yes, I'm sorry.

1063
01:25:25,082 --> 01:25:27,077
Save that for later.

1064
01:25:28,022 --> 01:25:32,041
Anyway, what happened?
The artificial sun disappeared.

1065
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:35,050
We destroyed the Tenseigan.
It was the power source

1066
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:37,023
driving everything here.

1067
01:25:37,023 --> 01:25:39,022
The moon should've stopped moving too.

1068
01:25:39,028 --> 01:25:40,028
What?

1069
01:25:48,051 --> 01:25:52,048
The treasure that my entire clan
offered up their eyes to realize...

1070
01:25:52,048 --> 01:25:54,007
The Otsutsuki treasure...

1071
01:25:54,058 --> 01:25:55,084
How dare they!

1072
01:25:57,001 --> 01:25:58,023
Hanabi!

1073
01:25:58,063 --> 01:26:00,038
Thank you.

1074
01:26:00,090 --> 01:26:02,086
This is yours, right?

1075
01:26:07,044 --> 01:26:12,027
Isn't that the scarf Toneri ripped off?

1076
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:14,099
How did you know?

1077
01:26:15,002 --> 01:26:17,093
When I pulled Toneri's jutsu from your body,

1078
01:26:17,093 --> 01:26:20,030
I was able to see your memories.

1079
01:26:20,097 --> 01:26:23,059
You were going to give it to Naruto, right?

1080
01:26:28,015 --> 01:26:30,075
Did you make it for me?

1081
01:26:31,039 --> 01:26:33,039
Y-yeah...

1082
01:26:33,098 --> 01:26:36,088
Can I have it?

1083
01:26:37,043 --> 01:26:40,046
But, it's in shreds.

1084
01:26:41,023 --> 01:26:42,069
I don't care.

1085
01:26:43,071 --> 01:26:47,035
I mean, I still want it.

1086
01:27:02,074 --> 01:27:04,036
Thank you.

1087
01:27:08,001 --> 01:27:09,063
I'll cherish it.

1088
01:27:14,032 --> 01:27:15,057
Naruto...

1089
01:27:20,086 --> 01:27:22,001
What's the matter?

1090
01:27:22,075 --> 01:27:23,079
The clock...

1091
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:26,025
It's moving.

1092
01:27:29,098 --> 01:27:33,041
With these eyes, Naruto,

1093
01:27:33,094 --> 01:27:38,021
I will destroy your world.

1094
01:27:41,028 --> 01:27:44,007
It's too dangerous to destroy the moon.

1095
01:27:44,014 --> 01:27:47,016
As long as that bomb we call a moon exists,

1096
01:27:47,048 --> 01:27:50,010
the Earth will not be safe!

1097
01:27:50,049 --> 01:27:52,075
Now let's discuss this calmly.

1098
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:55,029
Right now, the moon has stopped its approach.

1099
01:27:55,029 --> 01:27:57,074
No, it hasn't stopped.

1100
01:27:57,074 --> 01:27:58,091
What?

1101
01:28:03,093 --> 01:28:06,011
Why is the clock ticking again?

1102
01:28:06,022 --> 01:28:07,020
I don't know.

1103
01:28:12,086 --> 01:28:14,011
W-what was that?

1104
01:28:34,058 --> 01:28:36,038
Kurama!

1105
01:29:15,052 --> 01:29:16,052
Kurama!

1106
01:29:17,078 --> 01:29:18,094
It's Toneri!

1107
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:35,080
Silver Wheel Rebirth Explosion!

1108
01:29:57,075 --> 01:30:00,013
Chakra capacity at 90%

1109
01:30:00,044 --> 01:30:01,046
Lord Hokage!

1110
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:03,091
Hiashi would like to speak with you.

1111
01:30:04,018 --> 01:30:05,025
Hiashi?

1112
01:30:06,082 --> 01:30:10,062
Do not destroy the moon...

1113
01:30:11,050 --> 01:30:14,057
I'm certain that Hanabi and Hinata are there.

1114
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,073
What do you mean by that?

1115
01:30:16,096 --> 01:30:18,022
Bad news...

1116
01:30:18,022 --> 01:30:19,000
What is it?

1117
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,086
The Nine Tails is on the moon's surface.

1118
01:30:20,086 --> 01:30:21,043
What?

1119
01:30:51,079 --> 01:30:54,015
Chakra capacity at 95%

1120
01:30:54,099 --> 01:30:57,056
Lord Raikage, an urgent message from Lord Hokage.

1121
01:30:57,074 --> 01:30:59,078
What does he want at a time like this?

1122
01:31:00,027 --> 01:31:02,035
Please hold off on the chakra cannons.

1123
01:31:02,035 --> 01:31:04,016
Naruto and the others are on the moon.

1124
01:31:04,016 --> 01:31:05,050
That can't be helped.

1125
01:31:05,057 --> 01:31:08,066
They have to be sacrificed
for the sake of humanity and the Earth.

1126
01:31:08,066 --> 01:31:11,042
We're going to fire the Chakra
Transportation Cannon!

1127
01:31:11,042 --> 01:31:12,075
Lord Raikage...

1128
01:31:12,075 --> 01:31:13,046
What is it?

1129
01:31:13,056 --> 01:31:16,086
I'm asking you too.
Can you postpone for one hour?

1130
01:31:16,088 --> 01:31:17,061
What?

1131
01:31:17,061 --> 01:31:18,098
I have to agree.

1132
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:20,005
Mizukage?!

1133
01:31:20,006 --> 01:31:22,015
Naruto is a hero
of the last great war.

1134
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:24,025
He's worth betting on.

1135
01:31:24,038 --> 01:31:25,053
Tsuchikage?!

1136
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:31,066
Just one hour will do.

1137
01:31:32,026 --> 01:31:35,080
For them, that amount of time
will be worth a lifetime

1138
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:39,074
that can never be replaced!

1139
01:31:40,042 --> 01:31:41,095
What do you base that on?

1140
01:31:42,084 --> 01:31:45,011
My intuition.

1141
01:31:46,064 --> 01:31:48,051
Hinata, are you okay?

1142
01:31:48,059 --> 01:31:49,039
Y-yes.

1143
01:31:52,013 --> 01:31:53,043
No!

1144
01:32:02,033 --> 01:32:04,046
I'm taking Hinata back.

1145
01:32:06,022 --> 01:32:08,075
You can watch his last moments from there.

1146
01:32:12,098 --> 01:32:13,098
Hinata!

1147
01:32:22,024 --> 01:32:23,064
Naruto!

1148
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:53,018
The world created by
The Sage of the Six Paths is a failure.

1149
01:32:53,048 --> 01:32:56,035
I will put an end to 
both the Earth and to you!

1150
01:32:59,091 --> 01:33:03,090
I'll never let the Earth be destroyed!

1151
01:33:14,011 --> 01:33:15,039
Rasen Rengan!

1152
01:33:33,091 --> 01:33:36,028
Golden Wheel Rebirth Explosion!

1153
01:33:38,046 --> 01:33:39,046
Naruto!

1154
01:33:56,075 --> 01:33:58,008
What is that?

1155
01:34:02,039 --> 01:34:03,047
The moon...

1156
01:34:03,050 --> 01:34:04,093
The moon has split apart!

1157
01:34:04,099 --> 01:34:05,099
What?

1158
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:09,060
What's happening?

1159
01:34:10,046 --> 01:34:11,034
Hey, Hokage...

1160
01:34:11,048 --> 01:34:13,003
There's ten minutes left!

1161
01:34:16,088 --> 01:34:18,073
It's finally over.

1162
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:23,003
It's not over yet!

1163
01:34:25,004 --> 01:34:26,062
What?!

1164
01:34:36,046 --> 01:34:38,077
Chou Oodama Rasen

1165
01:34:38,077 --> 01:34:39,097
Tarrengan!

1166
01:35:04,065 --> 01:35:07,011
It's useless. Just give up.

1167
01:35:07,049 --> 01:35:09,002
Like I'd ever give up.

1168
01:35:09,047 --> 01:35:12,003
It takes time to knit a scarf.

1169
01:35:12,003 --> 01:35:14,055
The deeper the feelings
that you want to convey,

1170
01:35:14,064 --> 01:35:17,071
the longer it takes to knit.

1171
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,055
With this, it's over!

1172
01:35:28,027 --> 01:35:30,068
Like I'd ever let you!

1173
01:35:31,042 --> 01:35:33,025
To convey your feelings,

1174
01:35:33,025 --> 01:35:37,004
It takes much, much, more time!

1175
01:35:37,053 --> 01:35:38,097
That's why...

1176
01:35:38,097 --> 01:35:43,060
I can't let it end so easily!

1177
01:35:58,050 --> 01:35:59,000
You...

1178
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:03,014
...defeated me, with one punch.

1179
01:36:05,048 --> 01:36:07,095
The Tenseigan is fading?!

1180
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:20,068
Hinata!

1181
01:36:20,082 --> 01:36:22,008
Naruto!

1182
01:36:28,099 --> 01:36:31,053
I'm taking back Hanabi's eyes.

1183
01:36:32,011 --> 01:36:35,057
No, stop!

1184
01:36:36,086 --> 01:36:38,015
Why you!?

1185
01:36:38,083 --> 01:36:41,053
This is over.

1186
01:36:42,073 --> 01:36:43,077
Not yet!

1187
01:36:48,004 --> 01:36:49,073
Sakura, are you okay?

1188
01:36:49,079 --> 01:36:51,068
What about Naruto and the others?

1189
01:36:51,071 --> 01:36:53,042
I don't know.

1190
01:36:57,039 --> 01:36:59,073
W-what is going on?

1191
01:37:05,001 --> 01:37:08,042
I'll end it all with these eyes.

1192
01:37:08,092 --> 01:37:10,048
Puppet rebirth!

1193
01:37:16,065 --> 01:37:18,042
You're annoying!

1194
01:37:24,007 --> 01:37:25,004
Naruto.

1195
01:37:25,025 --> 01:37:26,025
Hinata!

1196
01:37:28,054 --> 01:37:30,028
Toneri, please stop already!

1197
01:37:30,028 --> 01:37:33,052
All you did was follow your ancestor's
misguided teachings.

1198
01:37:33,056 --> 01:37:37,066
Quiet! As the last survivor of the
Otsutsuki clan

1199
01:37:37,070 --> 01:37:41,031
I must fulfill Hamura's celestial decree!

1200
01:37:43,045 --> 01:37:44,064
Naruto?

1201
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:50,073
All my chakra's being sucked out.

1202
01:37:53,028 --> 01:37:54,065
Now you'll feel the power of Hamura.

1203
01:37:54,067 --> 01:37:56,057
The power to move the moon!

1204
01:37:56,065 --> 01:37:59,036
Naruto, it's over for you!

1205
01:38:04,055 --> 01:38:05,085
Hinata?

1206
01:38:12,089 --> 01:38:13,093
What?

1207
01:38:14,009 --> 01:38:16,043
This is not the end yet.

1208
01:38:16,055 --> 01:38:17,055
Why?

1209
01:38:17,088 --> 01:38:21,017
Hamura's chakra flows within me too.

1210
01:38:21,017 --> 01:38:22,060
Stop already.

1211
01:38:24,008 --> 01:38:28,066
End it. End the world of The Sage of the Six Paths!

1212
01:38:33,031 --> 01:38:37,022
I will destroy the Sage's world
that has fallen into darkness

1213
01:38:37,022 --> 01:38:39,044
with the light of justice!

1214
01:39:04,031 --> 01:39:05,026
What?

1215
01:39:05,026 --> 01:39:08,046
His jutsu absorbed the sun's energy

1216
01:39:08,046 --> 01:39:10,086
and now he's passed his chakra limit.

1217
01:39:20,008 --> 01:39:21,055
Naruto?!

1218
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:23,073
Don't! It's too dangerous!

1219
01:39:28,071 --> 01:39:29,097
Time's up.

1220
01:39:30,034 --> 01:39:32,088
Fire the Chakra Transformation Cannon.

1221
01:39:36,012 --> 01:39:37,031
What's wrong?

1222
01:39:37,031 --> 01:39:39,077
I can't shoot at Naruto.

1223
01:39:39,083 --> 01:39:41,055
You must stifle your personal feelings.

1224
01:39:41,055 --> 01:39:44,022
The very existence of Earth
depends on this.

1225
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,020
Move! I'll fire it!

1226
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:49,068
Lord Raikage,
there is something written on the moon...

1227
01:39:49,068 --> 01:39:50,080
What?

1228
01:39:51,031 --> 01:39:54,004
Kurama is writing something on the moon's surface.

1229
01:39:58,077 --> 01:40:00,033
That Shinobi character means...

1230
01:40:01,022 --> 01:40:02,050
'Mission accomplished'.

1231
01:40:02,063 --> 01:40:04,015
The mission was successful!

1232
01:40:11,017 --> 01:40:13,064
Emergency announcement to the entire world...

1233
01:40:13,064 --> 01:40:15,027
The moon has stopped,

1234
01:40:15,059 --> 01:40:19,014
thanks to the effort of these five:

1235
01:40:19,022 --> 01:40:23,020
Shikamaru, Sakura, Sai, Hinata, and Naruto.

1236
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:26,035
Earth and it's future are safe.

1237
01:40:27,054 --> 01:40:31,040
My intuition usually ends on a high note.

1238
01:40:34,056 --> 01:40:36,086
Making me write letters...

1239
01:40:36,086 --> 01:40:39,040
I'm no good at calligraphy!

1240
01:40:39,064 --> 01:40:41,047
Sorry, Kurama.

1241
01:40:49,041 --> 01:40:50,024
This is...

1242
01:40:50,096 --> 01:40:54,084
Hamura's soul guided me here.

1243
01:41:00,083 --> 01:41:05,060
Toneri, everyone
on Earth will welcome you.

1244
01:41:05,076 --> 01:41:08,095
I will remain on the moon
and atone for my sins.

1245
01:41:11,024 --> 01:41:12,040
Toneri...

1246
01:41:13,018 --> 01:41:16,002
One day...
One day, come to Earth.

1247
01:41:18,049 --> 01:41:22,020
The moon will never again approach Earth.

1248
01:41:23,057 --> 01:41:24,091
Never again.

1249
01:41:31,033 --> 01:41:35,000
Naruto, there is something
I have to ask you.

1250
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:36,040
What is it?

1251
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:39,022
That scarf...

1252
01:41:39,022 --> 01:41:40,077
Who gave it to you?

1253
01:41:40,084 --> 01:41:43,024
Oh, this.

1254
01:41:43,086 --> 01:41:47,042
My late Mom made it for me.

1255
01:41:47,042 --> 01:41:48,048
What?

1256
01:41:48,068 --> 01:41:51,086
My grandpa must've kept it for her.

1257
01:41:52,032 --> 01:41:53,032
Mom...

1258
01:41:54,031 --> 01:41:55,082
I see.

1259
01:41:55,082 --> 01:41:57,031
I'm so silly.

1260
01:41:57,031 --> 01:41:59,028
Hey, Sis!

1261
01:41:59,028 --> 01:42:03,008
How long are you going to chitchat?
I'm going on ahead of you!

1262
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:06,037
Hurry up. The passageway is starting to disintegrate.

1263
01:42:08,063 --> 01:42:10,088
Let's go home to Earth.

1264
01:42:11,027 --> 01:42:12,027
Yes.

1265
01:42:30,008 --> 01:42:31,015
Hinata...

1266
01:42:32,013 --> 01:42:34,044
Back in school when we were asked

1267
01:42:34,044 --> 01:42:37,013
who we'd want to spend
our last day on Earth with...

1268
01:42:37,014 --> 01:42:39,090
I couldn't write anyone's name down.

1269
01:42:39,090 --> 01:42:43,050
I didn't know my parents and didn't have any friends.

1270
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:47,044
But now, I know
exactly who I'd choose.

1271
01:42:48,017 --> 01:42:51,048
I want to stay with you!

1272
01:42:51,048 --> 01:42:56,006
Now and forever,
until the day I die.

1273
01:42:56,087 --> 01:42:59,000
I want to be with you, Hinata.

1274
01:43:01,004 --> 01:43:02,034
Naruto...

1275
01:44:44,058 --> 01:44:45,076
Naruto...

1276
01:44:45,078 --> 01:44:48,013
Hinata, put your arms around me.

1277
01:44:50,052 --> 01:44:51,086
O-okay.

1278
01:44:52,088 --> 01:44:55,015
Don't let go, okay?

1279
01:44:56,034 --> 01:44:57,045
I won't.

1280
